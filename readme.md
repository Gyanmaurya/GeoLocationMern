# Geolocation base address colculation of data useing Longitude and Latitude
# We can use tools 


# OpenStreetMap (OSM) - Nominatim API (Free) 

OpenStreetMap is completely free and open-source. You can use the Nominatim API for geocoding (converting addresses to coordinates or vice versa).
No API key required.
Free for all time (with request limits).
Ideal for testing.
Not as accurate as Google Maps for some use cases.
Limited to non-commercial projects.

# PositionStack (Free Tier)
PositionStack is a geolocation API that provides 25,000 free requests per month. It's great for testing without any initial costs.
Free for a reasonable amount of testing.
Provides forward and reverse geocoding.
You’ll need an API key.
You can register at positionstack.com to get your free API key.

# Google Maps API - Free Tier

Google Maps offers a $200 monthly free credit, which is generally enough for low-volume testing and development purposes. It includes the Distance Matrix API, which calculates distances between locations.
High accuracy.
Includes many features like distance matrix, directions, and real-time location tracking.
After exceeding the $200 credit, you’ll need to pay.
Requires an API key and billing setup (but no charges unless you exceed free credits).

# Local/Manual Testing (No External API)



### **High-Level Design for the Food Ordering Website**

#### **Technologies**:
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Redis
- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Additional Libraries**:
  - **OTP Generation**: `nodemailer` or `twilio` (for email or phone verification)
  - **Authentication**: `jsonwebtoken` (JWT for token-based authentication)
  - **Payment Gateway**: Integrate third-party APIs (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe)
  - **Security Enhancements**: Helmet.js (for securing HTTP headers), bcrypt (password hashing), and Redis (session management)

---

### **Key Modules**:

1. **Authentication and User Management**:
   - Signup and Login using OTP (email, phone).
   - Role-based access control (admin, restaurant owner, deskman, cook, normal user).

2. **Restaurant and Menu Management**:
   - Admin creates restaurants, adds deskman, and assigns the cooking panel.
   - Restaurant owner adds, deletes, and updates dishes with pricing.

3. **Order Management**:
   - Deskman and cook manage orders (order status changes visible to the deskman, owner, and cook).
   - User can place an order (full/half/quarter), cancel within 5 minutes.
   
4. **Payment Gateway Integration**:
   - Payment options: UPI, card, net banking.

5. **Booking and Reservation System**:
   - Users can book tables for dine-in, call for order, or opt for takeaway/delivery.

6. **Search and Geolocation**:
   - Search for the nearest restaurants (geolocation using a service like PositionStack).

---

### **Backend Design**:

#### **1. Authentication Service**:
   - **Signup/OTP Verification**: Use `nodemailer` or `twilio` for OTP verification.
   - **Login**: JWT-based authentication.
   - **Roles**: Assign role after the first login. (Normal users will have restricted access until admin assigns roles).

**Est. Time**: 8-10 hours  
(2-3 days, given 4-hour work sessions)

---

#### **2. Restaurant Management**:
   - **Admin**: Create a restaurant, add a deskman and assign the cooking panel.
   - **Owner**: Add dishes, update pricing, manage orders.

**Est. Time**: 12-16 hours  
(3-4 days)

---

#### **3. Menu Management & Cart**:
   - **Normal User**: View dishes in categories (Indian, Chinese, etc.) and sub-categories (Veg, Non-Veg).
   - **Cart**: Add food to the cart, checkout.

**Est. Time**: 10-12 hours  
(2-3 days)

---

#### **4. Order Management**:
   - **Deskman/Cook**: View orders, update status (cook status with a timer).
   - **Order Cancelation**: Allow normal users to cancel orders within 5 minutes.

**Est. Time**: 12-14 hours  
(3-4 days)

---

#### **5. Payment Gateway**:
   - **UPI/Card/Net Banking**: Use a payment gateway API (Stripe/Razorpay).

**Est. Time**: 8-10 hours  
(2-3 days)

---

#### **6. Reservation System**:
   - Allow users to book a table with all necessary details.

**Est. Time**: 6-8 hours  
(2 days)

---

#### **7. Geolocation & Search**:
   - **Search nearest restaurant**: Use a service like PositionStack or Google Maps API.

**Est. Time**: 6-8 hours  
(2 days)

---

#### **8. Security & Scalability**:
   - **Security**: Use Helmet.js to secure HTTP headers, bcrypt for password hashing, Redis for session management, CSRF tokens.
   - **Scalability**: Optimize queries, use caching, paginate results, and handle rate limiting.

**Est. Time**: 8-10 hours  
(2-3 days)

---

### **Frontend Design**:

#### **1. Authentication Pages** (Signup/Login/OTP Verification):
   - Design simple forms with OTP verification.

**Est. Time**: 4-6 hours  
(1-2 days)

---

#### **2. Role-Based Dashboards**:
   - Design separate dashboards for admin, restaurant owner, deskman, cook, and normal users.

**Est. Time**: 8-10 hours  
(2-3 days)

---

#### **3. Restaurant/Order Management Interface**:
   - UI for adding dishes, updating orders, and handling order status (for owner, deskman, and cook).

**Est. Time**: 12-14 hours  
(3-4 days)

---

#### **4. Cart and Checkout Flow**:
   - UI for adding items to cart, viewing cart, and proceeding to checkout.

**Est. Time**: 6-8 hours  
(2 days)

---

#### **5. Payment Integration**:
   - Design a payment form that integrates with the payment gateway.

**Est. Time**: 6-8 hours  
(2 days)

---

#### **6. Search and Filter UI**:
   - Search functionality and geolocation.

**Est. Time**: 6-8 hours  
(2 days)

---

### **Estimated Total Development Time**:

- **Backend**: ~64-76 hours (~16-19 days)
- **Frontend**: ~42-50 hours (~11-13 days)
- **Security & Scalability**: ~8-10 hours (~2-3 days)

**Total**: ~30-35 days (working 4 hours/day)
